# Real Madrid Club de Fútbol: A Comprehensive Summary

## 1. Overview & History

Founded on March 6, 1902, Real Madrid Club de Fútbol arose from the efforts of academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, who sought to introduce football to Madrid. Originally named Madrid Football Club, the club was granted the title "Real" (meaning "Royal") by King Alfonso XIII in 1920. Throughout its history, Real Madrid has undergone significant transformations, evolving into one of the most successful and recognizable football clubs in the world.

The club saw its first major triumph in 1905 when it won the Spanish Cup, and it became a founding member of the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909.

Under Bernabéu’s presidency, the team won five consecutive European Cups from 1956 to 1960.

The era of "La Quinta del Buitre" in the 1980s, characterized by homegrown talent, kept the club among the elite. In the early 2000s, under Florentino Pérez's presidency, the club embraced the "Galácticos" policy by signing global superstars, which has continued throughout its history. The current phase, initiated in 2009 with Pérez's return, has seen remarkable success, including more Champions League titles in recent years, solidifying Real Madrid's status as a powerhouse in global football.
