# Atlético Madrid: A Comprehensive Overview

## 1. Overview & History

Founded on April 26, 1903, Atlético Madrid began as Athletic Club Sucursal de Madrid, a youth branch of Athletic Bilbao. The club adopted its iconic red and white striped colors in 1910, which are said to have been inspired by Southampton FC's kits. Initially playing at the Ronda de Vallecas, Atlético gained independence from Athletic Bilbao in 1921 and moved to the Estadio Metropolitano.

The club experienced a series of transformations throughout its history, including a merger with Aviación Nacional during the Spanish Civil War, which led to the name change to Athletic Aviación de Madrid. The club enjoyed its first La Liga title in 1939-40 and continued to find success in the following decades, including a golden age from 1947 to 1965, where they won multiple league titles and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1962.

Under the management of Luis Aragonés from 1974 to 1987, Atlético won several domestic trophies but faced challenges in European competitions. The club underwent a tumultuous period in the late 20th century, marked by financial instability and relegation. However, the sale of star player Fernando Torres in 2007 marked a turning point, leading to a revival under manager Diego Simeone starting in 2011, which brought renewed success and a more competitive stature in both domestic and European football.
