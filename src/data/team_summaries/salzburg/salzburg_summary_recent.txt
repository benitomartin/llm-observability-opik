### Recent Achievements (2020-2025)

FC Red Bull Salzburg has continued to solidify its dominance in Austrian football and make strides on the European stage from 2020 to 2025. The club won the Austrian Bundesliga title in the 2020-21, 2021-22, and 2022-23 seasons, showcasing its consistent performance in domestic competitions. Additionally, Salzburg secured the Austrian Cup in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons, achieving a domestic double in both years.

In European competitions, Salzburg reached the knockout stage of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in the 2021-22 season, where they faced Bayern Munich in the round of 16. Their success in the UEFA Youth League was also notable, as they reached the semifinals in 2024-25, further highlighting the club's commitment to developing young talent.

### Current Performance (2023-2025)

As of the 2023-24 season, FC Red Bull Salzburg has been actively competing in both the Austrian Bundesliga and the UEFA Champions League. The club's UEFA coefficient ranking stands at 39, with a total of 46 points, indicating a solid standing among European clubs. However, the team faced challenges in the 2023-24 Champions League group stage, finishing fourth in Group D, which included notable teams such as Benfica and Internazionale.

In the domestic league, Salzburg is currently pursuing another title, although they are trailing behind the league leaders by a 10-point deficit as of December 2024. The club's performance has been characterized by a blend of experienced players and emerging talents, maintaining its reputation as a breeding ground for future stars.

### Latest Developments (2025)

In April 2024, FC Red Bull Salzburg qualified for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States, marking a significant milestone for the club on the global stage. This qualification was secured following Arsenal's elimination from the 2023-24 UEFA Champions League.

However, the club has also faced internal challenges, leading to the departure of head coach Pepijn Lijnders in December 2024 due to poor performances in both the Champions League and the Austrian Bundesliga. The coaching staff is currently under review, with VÃ­tor Matos serving as the assistant head coach, indicating a potential shift in strategy as the club aims to regain its competitive edge in both domestic and international competitions.
