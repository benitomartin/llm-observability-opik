In the 2022-23 season, the club achieved a historic continental treble, winning the Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League. This marked their first Champions League title, secured with a 1-0 victory over Inter Milan in the final held in Istanbul. The road to this victory included impressive wins against top European teams, such as Bayern Munich and Real Madrid.

In addition to their treble, City won the Premier League title for the third consecutive season in 2022-23, further demonstrating their dominance in English football. The club continued its success into the following season, winning the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, and making history as the first English men's club to win four consecutive Premier League titles.

The squad features star players like Erling Haaland, who has made a significant impact since joining the club, and Kevin De Bruyne, who serves as the team captain.

City's consistent performance has kept them at the top of the Premier League standings, and they are expected to challenge for further silverware in the current season.
