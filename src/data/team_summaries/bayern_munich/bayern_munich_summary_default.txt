# Bayern Munich Comprehensive Summary

## 1. Overview & History
Bayern Munich, officially known as FC Bayern München, was founded on February 27, 1900, by members of a gymnastics club in Munich. The club quickly rose to prominence, winning its first South German championship in 1926 and its first national title in 1932. The rise of Adolf Hitler led to significant challenges for the club, including the departure of Jewish members and a decline in competitive success during World War II. After the war, Bayern struggled but eventually secured promotion to the newly formed Bundesliga in 1965, marking the beginning of a golden era.

The club enjoyed significant success in the 1960s and 1970s, winning multiple Bundesliga titles and three consecutive European Cups from 1974 to 1976. The 1980s brought a mix of domestic success and financial turmoil, leading to the club being dubbed "FC Hollywood" due to off-field distractions. The 1990s and 2000s saw a resurgence under coaches like Ottmar Hitzfeld, culminating in a treble win in 2013 and a sextuple in 2020.

## 2. Stadium & Facilities
Bayern Munich plays its home matches at the Allianz Arena, which opened in 2005 and has a capacity of 75,000.
