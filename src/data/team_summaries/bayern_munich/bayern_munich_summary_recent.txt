## Recent Achievements (2020-2025)

Bayern Munich has continued its tradition of success in recent years, achieving significant milestones in both domestic and international competitions. Under the management of Hansi Flick, the club completed a historic treble in the 2019-20 season, winning the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, and UEFA Champions League. This achievement made Bayern the second club in history to win the treble in two different seasons, following their first treble in 2012-13. In addition to the treble, Bayern won the FIFA Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup in 2020, completing a sextuple—a rare feat in football history.

In the following seasons, Bayern maintained its dominance in the Bundesliga, winning the league title for nine consecutive years from 2013 to 2021. Under Julian Nagelsmann, they secured their tenth consecutive Bundesliga title in the 2021-22 season. The club also won the DFB-Pokal in 2020-21, adding to their impressive trophy cabinet.

## Current Performance (2023-2025)

As of the 2023-24 season, Bayern Munich faced a challenging campaign. The club appointed Thomas Tuchel as head coach in March 2023, and he led the team to an eleventh consecutive Bundesliga title in May 2023, clinching the championship in a dramatic final day against Borussia Dortmund. However, the 2023-24 season marked a downturn, as Bayern did not win the Bundesliga, finishing behind Bayer Leverkusen.

In August 2023, Bayern made headlines by signing England captain Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur for a record fee of €110 million, aiming to bolster their attacking options. The club's performance in the Champions League and DFB-Pokal remains a focal point as they seek to regain their status as a dominant force in European football.

## Latest Developments (2025)

In May 2024, Bayern Munich confirmed the appointment of Vincent Kompany as the new head coach, following the end of Tuchel's tenure. Kompany received a three-year contract and began his managerial role with a promising start, leading the team to a 3-2 victory against VfL Wolfsburg in their opening match of the 2024-25 Bundesliga season. By May 2025, Bayern secured their 34th Bundesliga title after a draw between SC Freiburg and Bayer 04 Leverkusen, making them champions with two games to spare. The club continues to focus on rebuilding and enhancing its squad as it aims to reclaim its position at the top of German and European football.
