### Recent Achievements (2020-2025)

Borussia Dortmund has experienced a mix of successes and challenges in recent years. In the 2020-21 season, the club won the DFB-Pokal, defeating RB Leipzig 4-1 in the final, marking a significant achievement under interim coach Edin Terzić. The following season, Dortmund finished second in the Bundesliga, narrowly missing out on the title to Bayern Munich on goal difference after leading the table for much of the season.

In the 2022-23 season, Dortmund again finished second in the Bundesliga, showcasing a strong performance throughout the campaign. However, the club faced disappointment in the DFB-Pokal, where they were eliminated in the early rounds.

The 2023-24 season saw a significant transition as star player Jude Bellingham was sold to Real Madrid for €103 million. Despite a disappointing Bundesliga campaign, finishing fifth, Dortmund made a remarkable run in the UEFA Champions League, reaching the final for the first time in eleven years. They faced Real Madrid in the final but were defeated 2-0.

### Current Performance (2023-2025)

As of the 2023-24 season, Borussia Dortmund's performance has been characterized by inconsistency in the Bundesliga, finishing fifth and missing out on Champions League qualification for the following season. However, their performance in European competitions has been commendable. Dortmund successfully navigated the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League, defeating PSV Eindhoven, Atlético Madrid, and Paris Saint-Germain to reach the final.

The club's current squad includes notable players such as Emre Can, who serves as captain, and a mix of young talents and experienced professionals. The coaching staff has seen changes, with Niko Kovač appointed as head coach in early 2025, following a brief interim period under Mike Tullberg.

### Latest Developments (2025)

In 2025, Borussia Dortmund announced a controversial sponsorship deal with Rheinmetall, a military weapons manufacturer, which has faced significant backlash from fans and the public. The partnership includes marketing rights and a payment of one million euros per year until 2027. This decision has sparked discussions about the ethics of sports sponsorships, particularly in light of the company's involvement in the arms industry.

Additionally, the club is focusing on rebuilding and strengthening its squad after the departure of key players. The management is committed to enhancing the team's performance in both domestic and European competitions, aiming to reclaim its status as a top contender in German football.
