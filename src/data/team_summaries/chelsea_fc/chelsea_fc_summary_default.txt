# Chelsea Football Club Summary

## 1. Overview & History
Chelsea Football Club, founded on March 10, 1905, by Gus Mears, is based in Fulham, London. The club was established to utilize the Stamford Bridge stadium, which Mears acquired in 1904. Chelsea quickly gained a reputation for attracting star players and large crowds, achieving promotion to the First Division in their second season. The club's early years were marked by fluctuating league positions and a notable FA Cup final appearance in 1915, where they lost to Sheffield United.

In the 1950s, under manager Ted Drake, Chelsea modernized and won their first major trophy, the League Championship, in the 1954-55 season. The club experienced ups and downs through the following decades, including a financial crisis in the 1980s, which led to Ken Bates purchasing the club for £1 in 1982. The arrival of Roman Abramovich in 2003 marked a significant turning point, as he invested heavily in the club, leading to unprecedented success.

In 2022, following Abramovich's sale of the club amid geopolitical tensions, Chelsea was acquired by a consortium led by Todd Boehly, marking a new chapter in its history.

Chelsea has played its home matches at Stamford Bridge since its inception. Originally opened in 1877, the stadium underwent significant renovations in the 1990s and early 2000s, transforming it into an all-seater venue. Stamford Bridge has a current capacity of approximately 40,000 and has hosted various events, including FA Cup finals and international matches. The club also operates a training facility in Cobham, Surrey, which was completed in 2007.
